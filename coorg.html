            <p class="astanga_text mt-3 wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-delay="0.5s">Kotebetta is the third-highest peak in the Coorg region after Tadiyandamol and Brahmagiri. It is situated at a height of 1,620 metres at the border between Coorg District and South Kannada District. Location-wise, the peak lies between Madikeri town and Somwarpet and can be easily reached without hassle.
                The name Kotebetta is derived from the word ‘Kote Betta’ which means Fort Hill. The peak looks like a fort on the top of the hill, and that’s why it is named so. It offers an amazing trekking opportunity to tourists. The ten-kilometer-long trail from Hattihole to the peak offers some breathtaking views of the surroundings and makes the trek even more amazing. There is a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva at the peak where the trail ends. It is better to trek to Kotebetta Peak during the months between October and March with a travel guide.</p>

                It is located at a distance of around 30 kilometres from Madikeri town and just four kilometres before Abbey Falls. One has to hire a private vehicle to reach Mandalpatti base, as there is no bus facility available on the route. The best time to trek is between November and January, as the road is not developed completely and might become risky during the monsoon.</p>

            <p class="astanga_text mt-3 wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-delay="0.5s">Raja’s Tomb, also known as Gaddige or Gadduge in the native language, is one of the important monuments in Madikeri or Coorg. It is located on the northeast side of Coorg, at a distance of 1.5 kilometres from the town. This architectural beauty represents the pervading Indo-Saracenic style of construction.

There are carvings on the top of the corners as well as on the entrance. Lord Shiva is placed inside the tomb, and it is believed to be worshipped. There are a total of three tombs inside the monument.
